          <p class="articleHeader">Extra Judicial Killings</p>
          <p class="articleBody">When we were asked to choose an art to be reviewed, this art unknowingly caught my attention. But why is that? After a lot of thinking, my question just got answered. Maybe because this art represents what most of the Filipino were experiencing. Very timely, direct and sums up what is really happening on our beloved land, Pilipinas.
<br><br>
	Starting at the background, it was composed of the color white, black, and red. For me, the colors chosen by the artist was a good way to express his/her anguish towards the dilemma the Philippines is facing.
<br><br>
	On the center part of the painting, there are numbers of target were aimed. The animals, women and children, nature and our faith. But who is the one targeting these and killing it slowly?
<br><br>
	The animals were slowly dying because of the pollution we people made. We snatched their homes and claimed it for our own use. Some of us treat animals like garbage. The women and children got abused by some people because of their lack of strength. Some of them are victims of human trafficking, some of them got pregnant by the person who raped them. Our nature was slowly dying because of our selfishness. Our fate was easily swayed and sometimes can be bought by money.
<br><br>
	Yes! We people were the one killing these precious things around us. Didn’t we know that killing each of them slowly also killing ourselves? Each of us in this world have different part that we must play, without someone who will play its part, are you willing to play for the part for the living you killed?

          <p class="articleBody">The 2016 presidential campaign of Rodrigo Duterte was announced on November 21, 2015. Maraming mamamayan ang natuwa, sumuporta, at naniwala sa kanyang Adbokasiya. President Rodrigo Duterte, who was serving as Mayor of Davao City, had repeatedly refused to run for several months and turned down other presidential and vice-presidential aspirants' offers to be his running mate, including Jejomar Binay, Miriam Defensor-Santiago and Bongbong Marcos. On May 9, 2016, Duterte won the Philippine presidential election with 39.01% of the votes. During his campaign, he promised to kill tens of thousands of criminals and end crime within six months. His domestic policy has focused on combating the illegal drug trade by initiating the Philippine Drug War.
            <br><br>
            According to the Philippine National Police the death total passed 7,000 in January 2017, after which the police stopped publishing data. Following criticism from United Nations human rights experts that extrajudicial killings had increased since his election, Duterte threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the UN and form a new organization with China and African nations.
Sa kanyang tagumpay na makuha ang posisyon ng pagka President, maraming tao ang nagtiwala at nanatili ang pagsuporta lalo na't alam nila kung gaano kaganda ang naging resulta ng pamamahala sa Davao City ng ating Pangulo.
Davao City, officially the City of Davao (Cebuano: Dakbayan sa Dabaw, Filipino: Lungsod ng Dabaw), is a highly urbanized city in the island of Mindanao, Philippines. The city has a total land area of 2,443.61 km2 (943.48 sq mi), and has a population of 1,632,991 based on the 2015 census, making it the largest city in the Philippines in terms of land area. The city is also the third-most-populous city in the Philippines after Quezon City and Manila, the most populous city in the country outside Metro Manila and the most populous in Mindanao. Davao attained a high "safety index" according to Numbeo, a crowd-sourced survey website, which the Philippine national media has reported frequently, although the city has the highest murder rate and the second highest rape rate in the country according to national police raw data as of 2015. Rodrigo Duterte, mayor for 22 years, claimed credit for Numbeo's safety ranking, boasting that he killed the criminals. A vigilante group called the Davao Death Squad killed over 1,400 street children and alleged criminals while he was mayor, according to human rights groups.  " Davao " , ang lugar kung saan nagmula ang ating presidente. Ang lugar kung saan namayagpag ang kanyang pangalan ,kung saan nag umpisa ang kanyang adbokasiya. At ang lugar kung saan nagumpisa ang kanyang pamamahala.
Nguni't sa kabila ng mga suporta ,gayak at tagumpay.Maraming taong naulila , nawalan ng kanilang mahal sa buhay , at maraming tao ang humandusay. " Wag tutuluran nanglaban" , mga salitang ating maririnig sa kung saan. Mga taong matatagpuang nakahandusay ng walang kalaban laban. Mga naiwang pamilyang luhaan at naghihintay ng katarungan. Extrajudicial killings are becoming more rampant and the problem has assumed an astronomic increase in many countries of the world. It remains unsolved issue in the Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria and many other developing countries.
<br><br>
It has become a bi-dimensional issue because it now involves the government apparatus in one hand and on the other hand, the ordinary citizens taking laws into their hands. Therefore, besides killings that are politically motivated and the use of state apparatus to execute perceived enemies and alleged criminals, the public have equally been invested with self-help oriented killings. Lynching of alleged offenders has become the order of the day, people now appears to be less care about the judicial process; mob attacks and other form of lawlessness is now on the increase and remain unabated. This seems to be painting the picture of  the triumph of public brutality against the due process of law. The trend is now assuming a more dangerous dimension as it seems to have graduated from a personal concept of an eye for an eye syndrome to a community organized event. Ang konsepto at mahalagang kahulugan ng salitang " kalayaan " ay unti-onting naglalaho. Ang kapayaan ay hindi na malinaw kung na saan dahil ito'y unti-onti ng nagtago.

          <p class="articleHeader">Martial Law</p>
          <p class="articleBody">“Art is a way to express yourself and through that you can escape a bad situation”. It is true that art is a tool to explain our emotion and specifically this painting express the opinion of the artist about our government. This painting shows the great work that the artist put in. The artist used retro style color to maybe relate it to the idea or thought that he/she want the audience to portray it. Using black and white theme for this kind of artwork shows the creativity of the artist in connecting his/her topic in the painting. It makes sense because this painting is all about our past administration, specifically the Ferdinand Marcos era and our present government.
    <br><br>
“It seemed that freedom of expression had run amuck, or had run as far as the Government would allow it to go”. A quote that perfectly explain the present situation of our freedom of expression. This painting contains deep meaning and real punch in the face to all the people involve in those two administration. In my point of view, the artist build this painting with two sides but same meaning. The first one shows the midst of Martial Law era of late Ferdinand Marcos. We all know how Martial Law turned out. Countless dead bodies, families were broken apart, and most importantly freedom is just a word with no meaning. The artist shows reasonable facts that Ferdinand Marcos and President Rodrigo Duterte is much alike.
<br><br>
This two gentleman share the same insatiable drive for power with ability to control and destroy democratic institutions to ultimately achieve authoritarianism. The artist uses the Martial Law angle to show the same attitude of Marcos and Duterte about power. He/she paints the Last Supper to try and explain that maybe we don’t need another Martial Law today. Maybe the last Martial Law is enough and we don’t need to experience it again.He puts the “Last Suffer?” because we all know how brutal and scary what happened last time Martial Law is applied in our country. The television where Duterte’s face is in, is a representation on what will happen if he apply Martial Law in this modern day. In the Marcos era, his face is always in the television, in the newspaper, etc. The artist tries to show how will things turn out. The varying methods in attaining their goals widely differ because of the different circumstances of their times. Marcos’s swift and sudden imposition of Martial Law in September 1972 caught flat - footed millions of Filipinos, unlike Duterte’s logically calculated moves and acts there are clear signs that they are geared unmistakably the same.
<br><br>
Lastly, me as a student need this kind of art to know the truth. Knowing the truth is never been a bad idea but a great tool on how we help protect our country. This painting is a big eye opener to those who wants true change. Past is past but we can’t let our self be blind on what can happen if we continue to believe this malicious antics of our president. We only live ones so lets make I count. Don’t just stand there waiting on what will happen but begin to support everyone whose fighting for our country’s freedom. Because there is no freedom if you don’t know the truth.

          <p class="articleHeader">Proclamation No. 1081</p>
          <p class="articleBody">When we discuss Martial Law, the primary thing that rings a bell is the previous President who introduced it, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos. In truth, we accuse this individual for the disappointment that was military law. In any case, there are some who stand unfaltering in safeguarding military law as the best thing that at any point happened to the nation. It's been a long time since previous president and tyrant Ferdinand Marcos marked Proclamation No. 1081, setting the whole Philippines under Martial Law. As indicated by my perusing and comprehension, he did it to spare the Republic and to make what he called "Another Society.
<br><br>
At the end of the day, Martial Law is a definitive answer for bends developing issues in culpability. For me, Martial Law wasn't the best thing on the planet that happened to the Philippines. Military Law amid the season of Marcos wasn't proclaimed to reestablish peace and request. Nor was it pronounced to do useful for the nation. Cash and power is the main thing that can be heard. Marcos utilized a few occasions to legitimize Martial Law. I likewise differ that Martial Law was extreme answer for bend developing issues on guiltiness. There is guiltiness because of destitution.
<br><br>
For me, the benefits of Martial Law amid Marcos time is the general population were restrained when he proclaimed Martial, less auto crashes around evening time as a result of the time limit, there was peace amid the military law, Disadvantages, is the passing of vote based system. Marcos utilized a few occasions to legitimize Martial Law. The presentation had influenced individuals to be quiet for a minute. Suspended the social liberties and forced military specialist in the nation. There is no opportunity of the press. The privileges of the general population to talk and offer their supposition in that present circumstance was completely denied and denied.
